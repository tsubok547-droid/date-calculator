# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the **"くすりの日数計算機"** app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by tsubota kentaro (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use

The Application is designed with user privacy as a top priority. It **does not automatically collect or transmit any personally identifiable information** from you or your device.

All calculation data, history with comments, and application settings (such as theme color and calendar mode) that you create are stored **only locally on your own device**. This information is not accessible to the Service Provider and is not sent to any external server.

## Third Party Access

The Service Provider does not share your information with any third parties, as no user data is collected or transmitted by the Service Provider.

The Application may request permission to access your device's calendar. This permission is used **only when you explicitly choose to add a calculated date as an event to your calendar**. The Application does not read, modify (other than adding the event), or transmit your existing calendar data.

## Data Retention Policy

The Application stores data locally on your device. This data is retained until you either clear the application's data through your device's settings or uninstall the Application. You can also delete specific history items from within the Application. The Service Provider does not have access to this data and therefore cannot delete it on your behalf.

## Opt-Out Rights

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

## Children

The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application, please contact the Service Provider so that they will be able to take the necessary actions.

## Security

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information stored on the device. We recommend using device-level security features such as passcodes and biometric locks to protect the data stored on your device.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

This privacy policy is effective as of **2025-09-08**

## Your Consent

By using the Application, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at **tsubok547@gmail.com**
